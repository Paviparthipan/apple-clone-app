  "Good morning/afternoon everyone.
  My name is [Your Name], and I’m really happy to have the chance to introduce myself to you today."

  "I come from [Your City/State].
  I have completed my graduation in [Your Degree/Field if applicable].
  I worked as a Surveyor for 4 years, where I was responsible for [briefly mention key tasks – e.g., collecting data,
  analyzing reports, preparing documentation].
  This experience taught me discipline, attention to detail, and working effectively with teams — qualities that I
  believe
  are very useful in the tech field as well."
